## 🙋‍♂️ About Me
I'm an aspiring web developer, entry-level IT professional, and someone who enjoys building things that help people. I’m also on the autism spectrum, which shapes how I see the world — with deep attention to logic, detail, and systems. I love making clean, purposeful experiences on the web and in games.
